    "Write a program to tell you the ***highest*** number of nuggets that you ***cannot*** purchase! Re-read that just in case it went past you the first time! The highest number that you cannot get. For example, you can get 15 nuggets by purchasing and box of 6 and a box of 9 nuggets. You can get 18 by purchasing 2 boxes of 9 nuggets. But with no combination of 6, 9, and 20 can you purchase 17 nuggets. What is the highest number that you cannot get?!\n",
